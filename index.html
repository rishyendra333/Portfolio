            <p>My name is <strong>Rishyendra Medamanuri</strong>
            and I am currently a first-year honors student 
            and accelerated research scholar awarded with a 
            highly competitive research scholarship at
            UNC-Chapel Hill. I am double majoring in 
            computer science and statistics and analytics. 
            My professional passion lies at the 
            integration of machine learning concepts and AI, 
            specifically large language models, to innovative
            applications. My hobbies include playing tennis, 
            watching football, and relaxing to a good show
            or movie!
            </p>
            <p>
            I am an Eagle Scout who's hiked the 
            high-adventurous Philmont trial in 2021, 
            carrying a 50-lb backpack for roughly 50 at 
            elevations peaking at 14,000 feet over the
             course of just 12 days. Additionally, I 
            successfully led an ambition Eagle Scout 
            project that benefitted my local religious 
            organization. This project accumulated over 
            150 hours of dedication and my aspiration to 
            involve my community brought together many 
            diverse individuals to this cause.
            </p>
            <p>Fun fact: The horse's name is Rocky!</p>
